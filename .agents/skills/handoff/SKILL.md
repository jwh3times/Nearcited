# Handoff

Write a handoff document a fresh agent on another machine can continue from,
publish it to the shared Proton Drive **Handoffs** folder, register it as this
repo's active handoff, then close out the session. `/lets-go` is the receiving
end: it reads the map, resumes from the doc, and clears the entry.

Reach the folder and map only through the helper. It resolves the folder the same
way on Windows and Fedora (`~/Proton Drive/<account>/My files/Documents/Handoffs`,
or `HANDOFFS_DIR` when set) and keys the map by the `origin` repository name:

```bash
node .agents/skills/handoff/scripts/handoff-map.mjs dir          # the Handoffs folder
node .agents/skills/handoff/scripts/handoff-map.mjs get          # this repo's active entry
node .agents/skills/handoff/scripts/handoff-map.mjs set <file>   # make <file> the active entry
```

If the helper cannot resolve the folder, stop and tell the user: Proton Drive is
not running or not synced, and a doc written anywhere else never reaches the
other machine.

Run the shell commands through the POSIX shell (Git Bash on Windows). The map is
read and written only through `node .agents/skills/handoff/scripts/handoff-map.mjs`,
never with `jq` or by hand.

## How the Handoffs folder reaches this machine

Two transports, decided by what is installed:

- **Desktop client** (Windows) — the Proton Drive client keeps
  `~/Proton Drive/<account>/My files/Documents/Handoffs` in sync on its own.
  Writing into that folder is the whole sync; the CLI steps below are skipped.
- **CLI mirror** (Fedora, where no client exists) — `proton-drive` (the Proton
  Drive CLI) is on `PATH` and `HANDOFFS_DIR` names a local mirror folder. Nothing
  syncs by itself: each **Pull** and **Push** block below is run explicitly, and
  the cloud folder is always `/my-files/Documents/Handoffs`. A CLI reply of
  `You need to login first` means `proton-drive auth login` first — that is an
  interactive step for the user.

Decide once at the start: `command -v proton-drive` succeeds **and** the desktop
client's folder is absent means CLI mirror; otherwise desktop client.

## Steps

### 1. Survey work not merged to main

The other machine starts from `origin/main`; anything not merged there is stranded
on this one. Run `git fetch origin --prune`, then run every check below in the
public checkout and again inside `private/` when it is checked out:

- **Uncommitted** — `git status --porcelain -uall`.
- **Unpushed** — `git for-each-ref --format="%(refname:short) %(upstream:track)" refs/heads`.
- **Unmerged branches** — every local branch other than `main`, and every branch
  checked out in `git worktree list`. A branch is merged only when a merged PR's
  `headRefOid` equals its tip:
  `gh pr list --head <branch> --state merged --json headRefOid`. Squash merges
  leave `git branch --merged` blind here.
- **Open PRs** — `gh pr list --author @me --state open`.

When any check finds something, **alert the user immediately** with a block headed
`⚠ Work not merged to main` that lists each item with its branch, worktree, or
PR. Then continue; step 5 repeats the alert.

**Done when:** every check has run in both repositories, and each finding is in
the alert or the survey is confirmed clean.

### 2. Write the handoff document

**Pull** (CLI mirror only) — refresh the map before resolving the folder with
`dir`, so the entry written on the other machine is the one this run supersedes:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HANDOFFS_DIR"
proton-drive filesystem download -f remove /my-files/Documents/Handoffs/handoff_map.json "$HANDOFFS_DIR"
```

Summarise the session so a fresh agent can continue it:

- the current state, what comes next, and where the work lives (branch, worktree,
  PR, issue), placed against the
  [Build order](https://github.com/jwh3times/Nearcited/issues/15)
- local state the other machine lacks and must recreate: `apps/api/.dev.vars`,
  `apps/web/.env.local`, and whether the local Supabase stack held data that
  matters. Name the files; their values stay out of the doc
- each finding from step 1 and what the next session must do about it
- a **Suggested skills** section naming the skills the next agent should invoke

Reference specs, plans, ADRs, issues, commits, and diffs by path or URL instead of
restating them. Redact API keys, passwords, other secrets, and personally
identifiable information — the doc lives outside the repository. Refer to
private material by its path under `private/` and leave its content there.

If the user passed arguments, they describe what the next session will focus on;
tailor the doc to that.

Name the file `<repo-slug>-handoff-<YYYY-MM-DD>[-<topic>].md`, with the repo name
in kebab case (`nearcited-handoff-2026-10-04-first-live-provider.md`), and
write it directly into the Handoffs folder (`dir` prints it; on the CLI mirror
that is `HANDOFFS_DIR`). When the name is taken, choose a distinct topic so the
earlier doc survives.

**Done when:** the file is in the Handoffs folder, and a reader holding only it and
the repository knows what to do first.

### 3. Register it in the map

Run `set <file>`. The helper sets this repo's entry, stamps `Last_Updated`, and
prints the entry it replaced. A non-null `previous` is an unconsumed handoff you
just superseded — name it to the user; its doc stays in the folder.

**Done when:** `get` returns the new filename with `exists: true`.

**Push** (CLI mirror only) — the document and the map both leave this machine now:

```bash
proton-drive filesystem upload -f create-new-revision -t \
  "$HANDOFFS_DIR/<file-name>" "$HANDOFFS_DIR/handoff_map.json" /my-files/Documents/Handoffs
```

`create-new-revision` keeps the cloud's earlier map as a revision instead of
trashing it. The push is complete when the transfer summary lists both files as
uploaded (an unchanged file reports as skipped, which is also complete). A
summary with neither means the user's login lapsed — see the transport section
above.

### 4. Close out with end-session

Invoke the `end-session` skill and complete it. Its harvest can open, comment on,
or close issues and clean the workspace; wherever it changes something the handoff
doc states, edit the doc in place to match.

**Done when:** end-session's report is delivered and the doc agrees with it. On
the CLI mirror, an edited doc is pushed again with the same **Push** command; the
cloud copy is what `/lets-go` reads.

### 5. Report

Give the user the doc's path and the map entry set, including any superseded one,
and the reminder: run `/lets-go` in this repository on the other machine once the
doc is in the cloud folder (the desktop client syncs it within a minute or so; a
**Push** puts it there at once). If step 1 found anything, end the response with the `⚠ Work not merged to main`
block, updated for whatever end-session changed.
